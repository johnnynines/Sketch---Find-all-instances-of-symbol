# Sketch---Find Symbol on Artboards

This plugin is a fork of [Symbol Instance](https://github.com/nmwoods1/Sketch---Find-all-instances-of-symbol ) by Nick Woods. 

The instructions are the same except this will list the artboards in the drop down instead of the pages. It is super buggy when jumping to the symbol instance, however it will still list every artboard the symbol is on no matter how many artboards you have on a page. There has to be some use for that at least.

1. Select a symbol instance or master
2. Run the plugin (or use the shortcut cmd+shift+f)
3. A dialog is displayed with a dropdown that lists all of artboards that include instances of your symbol
4. Select an artboard from the dropdown and click 'Go'
5. The plugin navigates you to that page and selects the instances so you can more easily find them

* As with Nick's this will only find symbols that are not within child groups.
