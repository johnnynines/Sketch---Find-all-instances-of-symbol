# Sketch---Find-all-instances-of-symbol
A Sketch plugin that let's you find all of the instances of a symbol across multiple pages/artboards

1. Select a symbol instance or master
2. Run the plugin (or use the shortcut cmd+shift+f)
3. A dialog is displayed with a dropdown that lists all of pages that include instances of your symbol
4. Select a page from the dropdown and click 'Go'
5. The plugin navigates you to that page and selects the instances so you can more easily find them

*Note: For now, symbols must be in the top level of an artboard to be found
